## Description

_This webpage consists of a Track Selector quiz to help you decide which Epicodus program fits your interests. The page consists of a quiz that asks you 5 questions including name and desired salary. Then, using branching and JavaScript, the page determines which track is a good fit for you and displays your results in a modal that refers to the user's name directly._

## Setup/Installation Requirements.

* Clone the repository to your Desktop.
* Open the html file in your preferred browser.
* Alternatively, open in [gh-pages](https://hannah-k.github.io/track-selector).

_This requires a Desktop and a web browser_

## Known Bugs
_Ideally, the webpage would remain visible behind the modal. This page is not fully responsive to different screen sizes._
